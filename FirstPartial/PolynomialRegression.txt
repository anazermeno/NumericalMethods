%Inputs - x and y vectors

x=[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3];
y=[7.5, 3, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 14];

%Process - Use the corresponding regression formulas for
%the polynomial regression
size = length(x);

%Initialize matrix A in zeros and vector B in zeros
%substitute 3 for n to make it every case, must define n tho

A= zeros(3, 3);
B= zeros(3, 1);

%nested for to fill matrix A with the needed data
for reng = 1 : 3
    for colum = 1 : 3
        %In our space A[1][1] we have de variable size
        if reng == 1 && colum == 1
        A(reng,colum) = size;
        continue
        end
    %the rest of the matrix A will contain de sum of x elevated to the correspondent power
    A(reng,colum) = sum(x.^(reng+colum-2));
    end
    %We fill vector B with the sum of y * x elevated to the correspondent power
    B(reng) = sum(x.^(reng-1).*y);
end

%We solve the system of equations *must have the same number of rows
a = A\B

%Output - display results

a0= a(1)
a1= a(2)
a2= a(3)
